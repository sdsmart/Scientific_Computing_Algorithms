Scientific Computing Algorithms
-------------------------------
This is a collection of algorithms related to various scientific computing applications.

The algorithms are written in MATLAB and can be loaded into MATLAB and used.

### Algorithm Description
Rather than trying to explain each algorithm, I will just link relavent literature that explains them better than I could.
