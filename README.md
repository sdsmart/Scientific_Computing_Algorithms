About This Repository
=====================
This is a notebook of algorithms compiled throughout my Scientific Computing class at the University of Oklahoma.

The algorithms are written in MATLAB and can be loaded in MATLAB and used.

Algorithm Descriptsion
----------------------
Rather than trying to explain each algorithm, I will just link relavent literature that explains them better than I could.
